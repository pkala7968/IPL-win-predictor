# IPL Match Prediction Project

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts the winner of an IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket match based on various input features such as teams, venue, toss winner, toss decision, and average runs scored by each team in their last 5 matches.

## üìä Project Overview
The IPL Match Prediction project uses a machine learning model to predict the winner of an IPL match. The model is trained on historical IPL match data and takes into account features such as:
- Teams playing (`team1` and `team2`)  
- Venue of the match  
- Toss winner and toss decision  
- Average runs scored by each team in their last 5 matches  

The Flask app provides a user-friendly interface to input match details and displays the predicted winner.

## ‚ú® Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple web interface to input match details.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** A pre-trained model to predict the match winner.  
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Instant prediction results based on user input.  
- **Dynamic Dropdowns:** Dropdowns for teams, venues, and toss decisions are dynamically populated.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language.  
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application.  
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for training the model.  
- **Joblib:** For saving and loading the trained model and encoders.  
- **HTML/CSS:** For the front-end interface.  
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.

## üöÄ How to Use
### 1. Home Page
- Open the application in your browser.  
- You will see a form with dropdowns for teams, venues, and toss decisions.  

### 2. Input Match Details
- Select `team1`, `team2`, `venue`, `toss_winner`, and `toss_decision` from the dropdowns.  
- Enter the average runs scored by `team1` and `team2` in their last 5 matches.  

### 3. Get Prediction
- Click the **"Predict"** button.  
- The predicted winner will be displayed on the screen.

## üî• API Endpoints
### 1. Home Page
- **URL:** `/`  
- **Method:** `GET`  
- **Description:** Renders the home page with the input form.  

### 2. Prediction Endpoint
- **URL:** `/predict`  
- **Method:** `POST`  
- **Description:** Accepts form data and returns the predicted winner in JSON format.  

#### Request Body:
