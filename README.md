## 📊 Project Overview

The IPL Match Predictor is a machine learning project that analyzes match conditions and predicts the winner of an IPL match. It uses:
- Teams (`team1`, `team2`)
- Venue of the match
- Toss winner and toss decision
- Average runs scored by each team in their last 5 matches

The Flask app provides an interactive interface where users can input match details and receive predictions instantly.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Web Interface:** User-friendly form to input match data
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Results are calculated instantly based on input
- **Pre-Trained Models:** Models trained on IPL data from 2008–2024
- **Multiple Models Supported:** Gradient Boosting and Random Forest
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For model building and evaluation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
