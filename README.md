# IPL Match Prediction Project

This project predicts the winner of an Indian Premier League (IPL) match using machine learning models trained on historical data from 2008 to 2024. It includes a Jupyter notebook for model development and a Flask-based web application for real-time predictions.

## Project Overview

The IPL Match Predictor is a machine learning project that analyzes match conditions and predicts the winner of an IPL match. It uses:
- Teams (`team1`, `team2`)
- Venue of the match
- Toss winner and toss decision
- Average runs scored by each team in their last 5 matches

The Flask app provides an interactive interface where users can input match details and receive predictions instantly.
